/**
 * Marker for a runtime-item payload field the host refused to put on the
 * WebSocket because the event was too large to deliver.
 *
 * Why this exists: `RemoteAccessServer.sendRaw` terminates a socket whenever
 * `bufferedAmount + messageBytes` exceeds the outbound budget (4 MB by
 * default). A single oversized event — in practice an `image_view` /
 * `mcp_tool_call` payload carrying a multi-megabyte inline base64 image —
 * therefore disconnects *every* connected client, and because the same event
 * stays in the replay buffer, the reconnecting client is dropped again on
 * replay. That loop only ends when the replay window rolls over. Capping the
 * event at the publish boundary keeps the live stream deliverable.
 *
 * The omitted bytes are never lost: the full payload is persisted to SQLite
 * before the cap is applied, so the authoritative copy arrives over HTTP the
 * next time the client fetches that thread's history.
 *
 * The value is REPLACED rather than deleted on purpose. `item.updated` payloads
 * are shallow-merged into the previous payload client-side (see
 * `runtimeEventReducer.mergePayload`), so deleting the key would silently leave
 * the previous — possibly stale — value in place instead of recording that
 * something was withheld.
