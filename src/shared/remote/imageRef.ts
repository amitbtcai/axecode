/**
 * A host-minted stand-in for inline image bytes that were removed from a remote
 * payload.
 *
 * Inline base64 images dominate remote traffic — on a real transcript database
 * they are ~89% of all runtime payload bytes, with single items reaching 12 MB —
 * and they are why a runtime event can blow past the WebSocket outbound budget.
 * Replacing them with this reference lets the transcript stay small and lets the
 * client fetch each image once, on demand, from a cache-friendly URL.
 *
 * SECURITY: the reference addresses the image by **where it sits in the host's
 * own persisted payload** (`threadId` + `itemId` + `path`), never by a filesystem
 * path or URL taken from the payload. That is deliberate and load-bearing: the
 * renderer refuses to promote agent-supplied paths/URLs into an `<img src>`
 * (see `imageViewSource`), because a prompt-injected tool result could otherwise
 * trigger an outbound request or read a local file just because a thread was
 * viewed. A reference carries no agent-controlled location, so resolving it
 * cannot be steered — the endpoint re-reads the row and re-verifies that the
 * addressed value really is an inline image before serving any bytes.
