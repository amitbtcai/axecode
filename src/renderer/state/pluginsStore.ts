 * into the plugin folder and refresh.

 * Discovery is scoped: the app-global roots (bundled + the user plugin folder)
 * are shared by every project, while a project's own `.axecode/plugins` root
 * is only visible to that project. Lists are therefore kept per scope, keyed by
 * the project path, with `""` for the app-global scope.
