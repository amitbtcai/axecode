/**
 * Cumulative token-usage scope tracking for one Codex session.
 *
 * The app-server's `total.totalTokens` counter is an absolute, monotonically
 * increasing total per provider (Codex) thread. The main-process usage ledger
 * counts counter increases within a `(provider, scopeId, epoch)` key, so this
 * tracker draws those boundaries for one mapper:
 *
 * - `scopeId` is the CODEX thread id (not the AxeCode thread id). A fork or
 *   replacement provider thread switches the scope via {@link replaceScope},
 *   starting a new epoch whose first sample is a baseline (forked threads
 *   carry inherited history — that is not new spend).
 * - An incoming counter LOWER than the last emitted one means upstream reset
 *   the total (e.g. ContextWindowExceeded recovery); the adapter bumps the
 *   epoch here because the ledger itself stays heuristic-free.
 * - `fresh: true` is emitted only on the first sample of a brand-new provider
 *   thread (created via `thread/start`, not resumed or forked), telling the
 *   ledger the baseline is 0 so the first sample counts in full.
