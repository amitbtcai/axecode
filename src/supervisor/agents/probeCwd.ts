/**
 * Empty scratch directory used as `cwd` for ACP capability probes.
 *
 * Some agent CLIs (notably cursor-agent) walk their `cwd` at probe time via a
 * bundled `rg` indexer. When that cwd is the user's project or home, the scan
 * touches sandbox-protected paths (Photos, Calendar, Containers) and macOS
 * routes the access through `sandboxd` → `tccd`, attributing the request to
 * the responsible parent (AxeCode). The result is a launch-time "would like
 * to access data from other apps" prompt unrelated to anything the user asked
 * AxeCode to do. Pointing every probe at an empty, AxeCode-owned
 * directory keeps the scan contained.
 *
 * Posix only — TCC lives on macOS, and on Linux the home dir is generally
 * safe. WSL falls back to the project's posix path; Windows falls back to the
 * project's native (Windows) path. Callers on those platforms typically pair
 * this with `resolveProbeSpawnCwd`, which keeps the spec's own cwd handling
 * (`wsl.exe --cd` / `cmd /c`) untouched.
