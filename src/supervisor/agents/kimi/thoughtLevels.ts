/**
 * Kimi's `thought_level` selector (config id `thinking`) advertises `on` for
 * every model, but it is not an effort tier — it means "thinking enabled, tier
 * unspecified". Verified against kimi 0.33.0 (`session/new` followed by
 * `session/set_config_option` per model):
 *
 *   kimi-code/kimi-for-coding            -> ["on"]
 *   kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed  -> ["on"]
 *   kimi-code/k3                         -> ["low", "high", "max", "on"]
 *   kimi-code/k3-256k                    -> ["low", "high", "max", "on"]
 *
 * `currentValue` is `on` for all four, including the tiered K3 models. Kimi's
 * own picker never offers `on` next to the tiers (it shows `Low High Max` for
 * K3 and `On` / `Off (Unsupported)` for K2.7), so passing the raw list through
 * draws a fourth pseudo-tier and reports `On` as the selected reasoning level
 * for a K3 thread.
 *
 * ACP has no per-option "unsupported"/"disabled" marker (`SessionConfigSelectOption`
 * carries only `value`/`name`/`description`/`_meta`), so the untiered value can
 * only be recognized by its id.

 * K3 leaves `["low","high","max"]`), confirming it is the "no tier chosen yet"
 * placeholder rather than a level.
 *
 * Otherwise → just `on`. Keeping the single level, instead of reporting no
 * levels at all, is what lets AxeCode put an untiered model back into its only
 * state: Kimi carries the previous model's tier across a model switch, so after
 * K3 `max` → K2.7 the session stays on `max` (and even lists it as a K2.7
 * option) until `thinking=on` is sent explicitly.
