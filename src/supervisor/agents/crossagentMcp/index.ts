/**
 * Shared helper for injecting the AxeCode Crossagents MCP server
 * into agent runtimes. The supervisor hosts a single in-process Streamable-HTTP
 * MCP endpoint (`CrossagentMcpIngress`); each thread that opts in receives a URL +
 * bearer credential at launch so the agent can discover and spawn the other
 * connected agents as subagents. Most providers receive a per-thread token;
 * pooled runtimes can share one credential and route calls by a trusted native
 * session id.
 *
 * Mirrors the `browserMcp` module shape. The runtime resolves this endpoint
 * into the same provider-neutral MCP descriptor used for every server.
 *
 * WSL reachability: unlike the browser MCP — which tunnels through the in-WSL
 * `bridge.mjs` reverse proxy (its `/mcp` route is hard-wired to the browser
 * upstream with a fixed env token) — the Crossagents ingress uses PER-THREAD
 * bearer tokens that can't be baked into a shared per-distro proxy. Instead we
 * mirror `BrowserMcpIngress`'s network posture: the supervisor ingress binds
 * `0.0.0.0` on Windows so an agent inside a WSL distro can reach the host. HOW
 * it reaches the host depends on the distro's networking mode (resolved by the
 * host-side `WslHostAccessResolver`): in NAT mode we rewrite the
 * loopback URL host to the distro's default-route gateway IP; in mirrored mode
 * the native `127.0.0.1` URL works as-is and is passed through unchanged. The
 * per-thread bearer token stays the security boundary — see
 * `resolveCrossagentMcpHttpConfigForLaunch` and `CrossagentMcpIngress.start`.
