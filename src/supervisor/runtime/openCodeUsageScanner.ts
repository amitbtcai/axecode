 * Builds the OpenCode usage snapshot.

 * Go plan quota meters (rolling / weekly / monthly) come **only** from the
 * opencode.ai web session (`lite.subscription.get` / dashboard). Local
 * `opencode.db` cost aggregation is intentionally not used for those meters:
 * it is device-local, undercounts multi-client spend, and uses different
 * window boundaries than the server — so falling back to it presents
 * confidently wrong headroom (e.g. 25% local vs 100% on the console).
 *
 * Local `auth.json` is still used as a "has a Go key" signal for the plan
 * badge when the web session is missing; meters stay empty until a cookie
 * session supplies real windows. Zen balance is web-only.
