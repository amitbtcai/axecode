 * PATH overrides) are sourced. Those startup files also print banners: a WSL
 * distro that was powered off emits Ubuntu's full MOTD ("Welcome to Ubuntu
 * 24.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux …)") on the first shell after boot, which lands on
 * stdout ahead of the CLI's answer and gets parsed as the result — e.g. a new
 * thread titled "Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS".
 *
 * Printing a sentinel as the script's first statement separates shell startup
 * noise from the command's real output; {@link stripOneShotBanner} drops
 * everything up to it. No-op for specs that aren't shell-script invocations
 * (native Windows/PowerShell, or a direct absolute-path exec).
