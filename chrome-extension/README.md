# AxeCode Chrome Control

Companion browser extension that lets AxeCode agents drive your **real**
Chrome / Brave / Edge — your actual tabs, cookies, and logged-in sessions. It is
the external-browser counterpart to AxeCode's built-in **Browser** panel; the
two run side by side.

## How it works

```
Agent → chrome MCP server (AxeCode) → localhost WebSocket → this extension → chrome.debugger (CDP) → your tabs
```

The extension holds no logic of its own: it relays Chrome DevTools Protocol
(CDP) commands from AxeCode to `chrome.debugger` and forwards CDP events back.
Attaching shows Chrome's own **"AxeCode started debugging this browser"** banner
on the driven tab — that banner is your consent + kill switch.

## Load it (unpacked)

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`, `edge://extensions`).
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. **Load unpacked** → select this `chrome-extension/` folder.

That's it — no pairing, no buttons. The extension pairs with the AxeCode
**app**: whenever the app is running it connects automatically and the popup
shows a green **Connected**; when the app is closed it quietly retries and
reconnects the moment the app launches again. It scans AxeCode's default local
port range, so there is nothing to enter.

## Use it

In a Claude thread, the agent has a `chrome` MCP server alongside `browser`. Try:
_"Use the chrome tools: check status, list my tabs, then screenshot the active
one."_ Good first calls: `chrome_status` → `chrome_list_tabs` → `chrome_attach`
→ `chrome_snapshot` / `chrome_screenshot`.

## Security notes

- The WebSocket is bound to `127.0.0.1` and only accepts browser-extension
  origins (a web page's `http(s)` origin is rejected), so random sites can't
  reach it. A per-launch bearer token is also available for hardened setups.
- Actual control always surfaces Chrome's "started debugging this browser"
  banner — stop a session any time from there.
- `chrome_eval` and `chrome_cookies` are gated behind the same
  eval / data-access switches as the embedded browser (AxeCode → Settings →
  Browser). They stay off unless you enable them.
- This drives your authenticated browser. Treat agent actions as your own.

## Current limitations

- Trusts any browser-extension-origin connection on loopback. The extension ID
  should be pinned before wider distribution.
- Wired for the Claude provider and always-on. A per-thread toggle and support
  for the other providers plus WSL are still pending.
